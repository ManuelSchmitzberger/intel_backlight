This is a simple bash script that would control the screen brightness. 
Tested on Arch Linux with intel card which manages the brightness.
See https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Backlight for more details.

Basic usage:
	Run the script as root.
	Keys: 	up arrow 	= 	increases the brightness
		down arrow 	= 	decreases the brightess

Any comments are welcomed :)
